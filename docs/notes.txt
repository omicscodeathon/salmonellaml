Notes:
Evaluation of Results/Hypothesis:
- Go beyond visual comparison with the published results of an existing literature or reproduced paper
- Figures should have good resolution and labels should be readable

The following are preferred,
- Balanced dataset
- If available, different omic data types can be compared (depending on what the project is about)
- The inclusion/exclusion selection criteria for the sequences that were analyzed.


These other possible validation approaches can be done:
- Crossing different studies in databases that are related to the condition being studied

Use case or Novelty:
- Highlight the specific use case(s) where this proposed solution is particularly relevant.
- In your benchmarking, you can see if you can  work with hardware specs that could be available to a typical biologist.
